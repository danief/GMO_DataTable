Wild-caught individuals of commonest species, Cyclotrachelus iowensis, collected from control fields, were used for a laboratory feeding trial, and fed either Bt Maize residue or non-Bt Maize residue. Cry1Ab concentration in beetles and in residues was assayed by ELISA.";"Carabid species; body size; concentrations of Cry1Ab in beetles, in residues.";3 species acquired Cry1Ab from both live plants and residues, 2 species only from live plants, 1 species from neither. Laboratory-fed C. iowensis acquired Cry1Ab from both. Larger beetles acquired proportionately higher amounts of Bt toxins than smaller. The authors conclude that carabid species vary significantly in their ecological roles in agricultural food webs. Some ground beetle species do acquire Cry proteins in GM Maize fields.

2016;Unknown;Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, Cry1F;Maize, Cotton;Herbivorous two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, and its predator, Ambyseius andersoni;Laboratory;T. urticae were reared in 1.5 mm tubes on leaves of Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab Cotton or Cry1F Maize. Bioactivity of Bt proteins after ingestion by mites was tested by applying crushed mites (in solution) to cabbage leaf disks fed to Bt-susceptible Plodia moth larvae. Predator mites were tested for Bt vs non-Bt preferences in paired choice tests (with spider mite prey). Prey-mediated effects of Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab Cotton on the predator were tested in a controlled experiment. Bt protein levels in Cotton and Maize were measured before and after infestation by spider mites. ;For spider mite experiments, ite survival rate, development time, fecundity, and hatching rate were measured. For Bt effects on predators, survivorship of each life stage of the predator was measured. Bt protein levels were measured using ELISA.;There were no effects of Bt on the biology of spider mites, or on their predator. The test with Plodia larvae demonstrated that spider mites did have biologically active Bt proteins in their bodies. Cry protein concentrations declined greatly as they moved from plants to herbivores to predators. Amblyseius predators showed no preference, in choice tests.;None;"The authors convincingly demonstrate that ""... T. urticae reared on Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab and non-Bt Cotton or Cry1F and non-Bt Maize did not significantly differ in any developmental or reproductive life history parameters even though they had ingested relevant levels of Bt proteins from Maize and Cotton.""

Aim was to study (1) effects of Bt Maize on rove beetle abundance and (2) competition between rove beetles and two other predatory groups (spiders, ground beetles). Ran experiment for three years. Replicated, random block design, comparing 4 GM Maize hybrids with their near isogenic (non-GM) lines. Arthropods were sampled weekly using pitfall traps in the center of each plot and yellow sticky traps on plants, from June until after harvest. ;"Insect and spider abundances; weed coverage";Nearly 6000 rove beetles, 76000 ground beetles, and 11000 spiders were collected. No variation in dominant rove beetle species between years or between treatments (Bt or non-Bt).

Over two years, arthropods and weeds were sampled weekly from plot centers in April to after harvest. 244 thousand arthropods were assigned to their positions in food webs.
